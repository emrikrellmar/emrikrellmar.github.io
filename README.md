# Calculator Web App

This is a simple calculator web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows the user to perform basic mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Usage

Open your browser and navigate to the application via [emrikrellmar.github.io](https://emrikrellmar.github.io/) to launch this PWA.

## Technology

* **Rich Text Format (RTF)** - RTF is a file format that allows you to exchange text files between different word processors across various operating systems.
* **HTML5** for structuring the content.
* **CSS3** for layout and styling.
* **Vanilla JavaScript** for handling the calculator logic.

## Web Application (PWA)

This calculator works as a PWA (Progressive Web Application), which means it can be installed and used offline when opened in a browser that supports PWA technology (such as Chrome, Edge, or Safari). Essentially, it can run like a standalone app.

## How to Download a PWA

To download and use your PWA offline, both your website and browser must be properly configured.

#### In Chrome:

1. When you visit your PWA website in Chrome, you should see a small icon (a plus sign in a square) in the browser's address bar, or a banner at the bottom of the page saying "Install App." Click on it.
2. Choose **"Install"** or **"Add to Home Screen."**
3. Your PWA will now be installed as an app on your device. It can be launched from the desktop (on a computer) or the home screen (on a phone or tablet) and will work as a standalone app that can run offline.

#### In Microsoft Edge:

1. Similar to Chrome, Edge will show an **"Install App"** button in the address bar if PWA features are properly implemented.
2. Click **"Install"** to add the app.

#### On Android (Chrome):

1. Open the app in Chrome.
2. A banner may appear offering to install the app. If not, tap the menu icon (three dots in the top-right corner).
3. Select **"Add to Home Screen."**
4. The app will be downloaded and displayed as an icon on your home screen.

#### On iOS (Safari):

1. Open the app in Safari.
2. Tap the **Share** icon at the bottom center of the screen.
3. Select **"Add to Home Screen."**
4. Give the app a name and tap **"Add."**

### The app will now be available on your home screen and function as a standalone app with offline support.
